<h2>About David Cylex</h2>
<img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Author Pic: David Cylex">
<p>David Cylex writes fierce, fast-paced fantasy where misfits bond with monsters—and become something more. He is the author of <em>Arcbeasts</em>, a sweeping sci-fi fantasy series about psychic creatures, secret legacies, and the power of choosing who you become.</p>
<p>His books are known for cinematic action, emotionally driven heroes, and world-shattering stakes wrapped in vivid, lyrical prose. When he’s not plotting Arcbeast battles or teasing rival-bonded romance, he’s probably overthinking plot twists and wondering if his favorite character survived the chapter.</p>
<p>David lives between futures—one full of technology, one full of magic—and he writes for the readers who do too.</p>
