    <h2>Arcbeasts: The Arcane Bond</h2>
    <img src="images/arcane-cover.jpg" alt="Arcbeasts: The Arcane Bond Cover">
    <p><b>Kael Emberling didn’t choose the fire. It chose her.</b></p>
    <p>In a tech-fantasy future where every sixteen-year-old is bonded to a sentient creature known as an Arcbeast, Kael’s turn was supposed to be simple. But when her bond triggers a forbidden Thoughtbinder-class Arcbeast named Nyx—an ancient being thought extinct—everything spirals out of control.</p>
    <p>Now labeled a threat to the system and hunted by those sworn to protect it, Kael is forced to question everything: the history of the Arcbeasts, the truth behind her own bond, and the dark memories that begin to rise from deep within Nyx.
    As rival students, corrupt mentors, and secret factions close in, Kael must decide whether to run from what she’s becoming… or embrace the power that was never meant to be awakened.</p>
    <p><b>In a world of control, Kael is chaos.
    And chaos remembers.</b></p>
    <p>Perfect for fans of <em>Eragon</em>, <em>Fourth Wing</em>, and <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, <em>Arcbeasts: The Arcane Bond</em> is a soaring sci-fi fantasy epic of elemental war, forbidden bonds, and the girl who learns the world doesn’t need a crown. It needs a fire that won’t go out.</p>

    <h2>Arcbeasts: The Storm Before The Flame</h2>
    <img src="images/storm-cover.jpg" alt="Arcbeasts: The Storm Before The Flame Cover">
    <p><b>Every legend has a spark. This one was forged in the storm.</b></p>

<p>In a future rebuilt from ash and steel, teenagers bond with living war-creatures known as Arcbeasts—beasts of fire, storm, light, and shadow, created to sync with human spirals and defend the fragile peace of the world.</p>

<p>Sixteen-year-old Valen Drayke has no legacy, no titles, and no patience for politics. But when he’s bonded to Zephra, a rare Stormrider Arcbeast with a rebellious streak, he’s thrown into Unit Ten: an elite strike team tasked with exploring the unstable vault zones across the fractured frontier.</p>

<p>What begins as a mission of training and calibration turns into something far more dangerous. Vaults once thought dormant are waking. Spiral glyphs are shifting. And beneath the surface, an ancient design stirs—one that could unravel the Council’s grip on power and awaken creatures long thought extinct.</p>

<p>Together with a squad of misfits, rivals, and one stubborn fire-wielding team leader, Valen must navigate shifting alliances, airborne battles, and the haunting call of a deeper bond he barely understands.</p>

<p>Before Kael Emberling.<br>
Before the Arcane Bond.<br>
There was the storm that nearly broke them.</p>

<p><i>Arcbeasts: The Storm Before The Flame</i> is a cinematic, emotionally-charged sci-fantasy epic of loyalty, sacrifice, and skyborn legend—set in the world of <i>Arcbeasts: The Arcane Bond.</i></p>
